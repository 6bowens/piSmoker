# piSmoker
Raspberrypi based smoker temp controller.

The rpi controls both a fan and servo/louver to increase or limit airflow going into a vertical smoker (kamada bbq). PID Controller uses temperature probe mounted within BBQ to measure actual temps (PV), set point (SP) defaults to 250F but can be updated via Blynk app.
